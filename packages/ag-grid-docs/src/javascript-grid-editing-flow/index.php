<h1>Editing Flow</h1>

<p class="lead">
    This section outlines the editing flow of data. That is the process the values goes through from
    editors and then into your data.
</p>

<h2>Configurable Steps</h2>

<p>
    When editing the following steps can be configured:
</p>

<table class="properties">
    <tr>
        <td>
            <b><a href="../javascript-grid-value-setters/#value-parser">Value Parser</a></b>:
        </td>
        <td>
            Allows you to parse values after an edit.
        </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>
            <b><a href="../javascript-grid-value-setters/#value-setter">Value Setter</a></b>:
        </td>
        <td>
            Allows you to put values back into the underlying data.
        </td>
    </tr>
</table>

<p>
    The flow diagram below illustrates how these different steps work together.
