<h1>Rendering Flow</h1>

<p class="lead">
    This section outlines the rendering flow of data. That is the process the values goes through from
    the provided data to ending up as HTML on the screen.
</p>

<h2>Configurable Steps</h2>

<p>
    When rendering the following steps can be configured:
</p>

<table class="properties">
    <tr>
        <td>
            <b><a href="../javascript-grid-value-getters/#value-getter">Value Getter</a></b>:
        </td>
        <td>
            Gets the value from your data for display.
        </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>
            <b><a href="../javascript-grid-value-getters/#value-formatter">Value Formatter</a></b>:
        </td>
        <td>
            Allows you to format or transform the value for display purposes.
        </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>
            <b><a href="../javascript-grid-cell-rendering">Cell Renderer</a></b>:
        </td>
        <td>
            Gets the value from your data for display.
        </td>
    </tr>
</table>

<p>
    The flow diagram below illustrates how these different steps work together.
