**Requesting support**
If you are a customer, please see providing a Feature Request, same policy applies for requesting support.

If you are not a customer, note that ag-grid staff will label your issue as managed-by-the-community,  this means that ag-grid staff is not going to be actively looking into it, and it will get closed if inactive for more than one month, the community is welcome to help with this question/support issue


**Providing a Feature request**
We offer two products:

ag-Grid - this is entirely free to use in line with our MIT license. (issues reported via GitHub)
ag-Grid Enterprise - our commercial version which funds the development of both versions. (issues reported via zendesk)

If you are a customer, you should be using ag-Grid Enterprise in which case you should have access to our customer support system (via zendesk), and that is the only channel where we accept feature requests.

If you are an ag-Grid Enterprise Customer, please raise this in our Zendesk support system - contact info@ag-grid.com for access. This is our primary channel for Support.


**Providing a reproducible scenario**
Accepted reproducible scenarios are
- A description of the detailed steps to reproduce your behaviour in one of our examples in the docs.

If you decide to send us a plunkr, from any example in our website use the plunkr button in there to fork your own code by following the steps below:

- Select the framework that is appropriate to you from the drop-down
