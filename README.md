Angular Grid
==============

Angular Grid is another Grid for HTML 5 Angular development. I created Angular Grid out of frustration because I couldn't find a grid that was very fast (sorry ui-Grid), allowed pinned columns (sorry Slick Grid) had excel like advanced filtering and was native to AngularJS (sorry pretty much every grid).

So I thought, how hard can it be? I guess I am finding out ...

Who Should Use
--------------

Everybody should use this grid!!

The grid was designed to handle very large data sets and give a professional 'excel like' feel over the data. This was such that it can be used in financial applications.

Personally I find the grid best suits my needs than any other. It is powerful and flexible enough to deal with any job I give it (regardless of needing 100 columns and 20,000 rows, or maybe I need to have the cells very custom and interactive) . . . . and still have the option to make it native Angular if I wish. I was not able to find a grid that fit nicely into the Angular modal and gave me what I needed.
