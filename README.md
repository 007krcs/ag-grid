Angular Grid is another Grid for HTML 5 AngularJS development. Angular Grid was created
out of frustration, following a long and endless search for a grid that was very fast,
allowed pinned columns, had excel like advanced filtering and was native to AngularJS.

Features
--------------

- Advanced Filtering (quick filter, excel like filter, custom filters)
- Row Virtualisation (thousands of rows)
- Column Pinning, Resizing & Sorting
- Grouping with Aggregation
- Custom Cell Editors & Renderers
- Styleable via CSS
- Very fast

Who Should Use
--------------

The grid was designed to handle very large data sets and give a professional 'excel like' feel over the data.
This was such that it can be used in financial reporting applications.

However you don't need to be writing financial applications to benefit. Setting up a simple grid, for small
data sets, with a bunch of features, is very easy.

Check out the examples and the documentation to see if it is a good fit for you.
