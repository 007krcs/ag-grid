            Angular Grid (ag-Grid) is another Grid for HTML 5 Angular development. I created
            Angular Grid out of frustration because I couldn't find a grid that was very fast (sorry ui-Grid),
            allowed pinned columns (sorry Slick Grid) had excel like advanced filtering
            and was native to AngularJS (sorry pretty much every grid).
        </div>
        <div class="paragraph">
            So I thought, how hard can it be? So I gave it a shot, the latest release has the following:
            <ul>
                <li>Native to Angular JS</li>
                <li>Excel Like Advanced Filtering</li>
                <li>Gmail like 'Quick Filter'</li>
                <li>Pinnable Columns</li>
                <li>Row Virtualisation</li>
                <li>Column Resizing</li>
                <li>Sorting</li>
                <li>Custom Cell Renderers</li>
                <li>Auto Fit Size (ie width & height to 100% works, and changing width and height)</li>
                <li>Very Customisable via CSS Look and Feel</li>
                <li>No Dependencies (apart from core Angular), no JQuery, no jqLite</li>
                <li>Supports very large data sets</li>
                <li>Very very fast (approx 0..60 mph in 0.024 seconds)</li>
            </ul>
            Grouping will be implemented at some point, the design has it ready to slot in, just don't need it
            right now for my current project, so I am not in a rush.

            I do not think a grid should be developed entirely in AngularJS. The number of individual cells (even
            when virtualising the grid) is to much for the data-binding design of AngularJS. That is why the design of
            ag-Grid is hybrid - using native Javascript and DOM manipulation for the critical 'underneath the hood'
            parts while still presenting the grid as a native AngularJS directive. If required, Angular data-binding
            can be used in the cells, but only when required, in my projects it has never been required.

            I work in investment banking. We have applications that display grids with tens of thousands
            of records with up to 100 columns. ag-Grid manages this data size with ease.
