    <div class="smallTitle">Enable Filtering</div>

    Turn filtering on for the grid by enabling filtering in the grid options.

    <p/>

    Bring up the filter menu by hovering over a column and clicking on the newly appearing column dropdown menu.

    <p/>

    In addition to the column specific filtering, a 'quick filter' can also be applied. Set the quick filter
    text into the grid options and tell the grid, via the API, to filter the data (which will include
    the new quick filter).
