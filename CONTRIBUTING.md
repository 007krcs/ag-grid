Contributing to Angular Grid
========================

To maintain the quality of the project, please don't feel offended if your contributions are not accepted.

Using issues
------------

The [issue tracker](https://github.com/ceolter/angular-grid/issues) is the preferred channel for reporting bugs, requesting new features and submitting pull requests.

Please do not use issues for support requests. For help using Angular Grid, please take a look at the [`angular-grid`](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/angular-grid) tag on Stack Overflow.


Reporting bugs
--------------

Well structured, detailed bug reports are hugely valuable for the project.

Guidlines for reporting bugs:

 - Check the issue search to see if it has already been reported
 - Isolate the problem to a simple test case
 - Provide a demonstration of the problem on [JS Bin](http://jsbin.com) or similar

Please provide any additional details associated with the bug, if it's browser or screen density specific, or only happens with a certain configuration or data.


Pull requests
-------------

Clear, concise pull requests are excellent at continuing the project's community driven growth. But please review [these guidelines](https://github.com/blog/1943-how-to-write-the-perfect-pull-request) and the guidelines below before starting work on the project.

Guidelines:

 - Please create an issue first:
   - For bugs, we can discuss the fixing approach
   - For enhancements, we can discuss if it is within the project scope and avoid duplicate effort
 - Please make changes to the files in [`/src`](https://github.com/ceolter/angular-grid/tree/master/src), not `Angular Grid` or `angularGrid.min.js` in the repo root directory, this avoids merge conflicts
 - If adding new functionality, please also update the relevant `.md` file in [`/docs`](https://github.com/ceolter/angular-grid/tree/master/docs)
 - Please make your commits in logical sections with clear commit messages
