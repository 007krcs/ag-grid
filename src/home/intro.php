                    <p class="text-left">
                        We became frustrated with JavaScript data grids as nothing satisfied our needs for enterprise JavaScript development. This frustration led to the creation of ag-Grid. It started as an open source project and has evolved into the most advanced JavaScript data grid on the market.

                        Most of our clients are moving from established JavaScript data grids and are enjoying the breath of fresh air that ag-Grid provides. The enterprise version of ag-Grid fuels the ag-Grid company. Our mission has been driven by our customers: keep doing what we are doing, building the world’s best JavaScript data grid.
