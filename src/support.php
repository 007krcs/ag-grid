As an ag-Grid Enterprise customer, you will have access to guaranteed support through the members only support forum.

Github Issues Usage
Github should not be used for requesting help. Issues in Github are for tracking bugs and potential features inside ag-Grid only.

Stack Overflow
Stack Overflow is the chosen platform for unofficial 'free' ag-Grid support. The employees of ag-Grid will look at Stack Overflow issues tagged 'ag-grid' and will answer questions that are worthwhile or 'interesting to the community'. However the ag-Grid team is under no obligation to participate in Stack Overflow questions.
