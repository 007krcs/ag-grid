    <p>The Material Next Theme is a new one.  Unlike the others, it is based on a different styling set, in order to conform more closely to the material design guidelines.,</p>

    <p/>
    <p/>
    To use a theme, add the theme class name to the div element where the ag-Grid directive is attached.
    <p/>
    The following is an example of using the ag-material theme:<br/>
    <pre>&lt;div ag-grid="gridOptions" class="ag-material">&lt;/div></pre>
    </p>

    <div class="bigTitle" id="material-theme-example">Material Next Theme Example</div>

    <p/>

    <show-example example="example-material-next"></show-example>

</pre>

</div>
