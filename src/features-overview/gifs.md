    - Modify source code to allow grouping
    - start ungrouped

    - change aggregation function for gold column

# filtering

# lazy loading
    - Use https://www.ag-grid.com/javascript-grid-enterprise-model/#example-simple

    - Use https://www.ag-grid.com/javascript-grid-data-update/#example-batch-transaction

# Tree Data
    - TODO: I don't like the demos we have. We need something with larger, more complex data, perhaps file structure - can dump something from `/usr/local`. 

# Customizable Appearance
    - Use https://www.ag-grid.com/example.php
    - Change balham => balham dark => material

# Convenient Licensing
    - MIT License logo / Commercial License pictogram (good luck making that)

# Commercial Grade Support
    - Static Image of two request => reply boxes, pseudo zendesk
    - I am not going to use animation here, to avoid the false idea that we provide chat support
