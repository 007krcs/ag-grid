            At the start of 2015 I was in a day job with a problem, I could not find a decent
            JavaScript data grid for our enterprise applications, so I wrote my own and called
            it ag-Grid. After presenting it at Angular Connect 2015 last year I quit my job to work on the
            project full time. By the time Angular Connect 2016 this year had come along, things had changed.
            This article describes the experience of this once small project becoming one of
            the major sponsors of Angular Connect 2016 - Europe's largest Angular conferences.

                Niall speaking at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gNhPeLCBbE0">
                Angular Connect 2015</a>. If my eyes look tired, it's because I was.

        <p>
            Speaking at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gNhPeLCBbE0">Angular Connect 2015</a>
            scared me. I had never spoken in public before, not mind to 1,000 people and streamed live on YouTube.
            I spent weeks preparing the talk and practiced in front of friends, work colleagues, my girlfriend,
            pretty much anyone who was willing to watch. I practiced my timing, cut out bad parts,
            identified items to focus on etc. The work required was tiring.
            When I delivered the talk, coming off stage, I could not recall what parts of the talk
            went well and which didn't - I had practiced it so many times, the real one and the practice ones
            were blurred and I was fatigued. Later that evening I watched the playback on YouTube
            and it had a surreal feeling, it was like watching a Ted Talk, ie someone else on stage, I couldn't
            really remember doing it.
        </p>

        <p>
            2016 for ag-Grid was very different different to 2015. Hardly surprising given I had quit my job.
            ag-Grid re-branded to be <b>Ag</b>nostic Grid
            (previously <b>A</b>n<b>g</b>ular Grid) to target all platforms and was busy creating a product offering
            for enterprise.
            The launch of ag-Grid Enterprise was a huge success and resulted in hundreds of customers.
            The company moved into Techhub@Campus (Google's London incubation centre for start-ups)
            and the ag-Grid core team started to get hired.
        </p>

        <p>
            I didn't apply to speak at Angular Connect 2016 as we were to busy in creating the ag-Grid company,
            I felt I didn't have the time to prepare another talk. One week before the conference, I bumped
            into one of the conference organisers and had a chat. When he heard I was not speaking he suggested that
            we sponsor. Wow. That thought had never occurred to me. We were so busy
            bringing the product to market and satisfying our customers we didn't think of taking the company
            to the next level with regards restructuring our image. People probably thought ag-Grid was still one
            guy in a bedroom earning some pocket money. There were different levels of sponsorship that you can take.
            The second from the top is Platinum and the only other Platinum sponsors were
            Angular themselves and Progress (the guys who own Telerik and KendoUI, our main competitor) and if they were platinum,
            it provided balance in my mind to match them. It was 5 working days to the conference, if this was
            going to happen, we were going to have to turn it around pretty fast.
         </p>

        <p>
            The next day I organised a task force in ag-Grid consisting of Sean (our lead Angular 2 tech guy),
            John (our head of Customer Experience) and I. I told them we were going to Platinum sponsor Angular Connect 2016.
            We worked on how much we could get prepared in 5 days and who was doing what.
            We organised printing a large backdrop for our stand,
            got to work recording a 20 minute demonstration of ag-Grid to play on repeat,
            bought an iPad mini to competition off, printed 1,500 fliers explaining who we were to drop into the conference welcome bags
            and prepared a 5 minute lightening talk to be given on the main stage on the second day.
        </p>

        <div style="float: left; padding-right: 20px; padding-bottom: 20px; padding-top: 5px;">

            <div style="padding: 0px; width: 400px; color: darkgrey; font-size: 12px;">

                we put it up, the day before the conference.
            </div>
        </div>

        <p>
            We arrived the day before and set up our stand. We pulled the ag-Grid backdrop out of it's packing
            and saw the 2m x 2m logo against the newly selected background for
            the first time (the background of the logo on our website wouldn't print well according to the print shop,
            it had too much black in it and the ink would bleed). We connected the 20 minute demo movie to
            the large rented TV and saw it play for the first time on something other than our laptops. We cleaned
            down the stand table and stood back. It looked proper. When preparing for
            the conference I had one rule - nothing should look unprofessional - if anything was to look cheap,
            it was to be left out.
            Our stand was in the main hall where food was served and between the two main conference presentation rooms.
            This is the prime location for a stand and given to the top sponsors as you get the traffic of attendees as
            they move between the conference tracks as well as where attendees hang out during breaks.
            Beside our stand was the Progress stand and then after that at the top was Rangle.io. To the other
            side was Angular Boot Camp. These were all well known brands within the JavaScript community so it
            felt pretty cool to be hitting at the same weight. We left and I mentally prepared myself for hardly
            anyone coming to our stand, just in case, that way I can only be positively surprised if anything
            better happened - I am not sure if preparing for the worst is a good thing to do, it's the
            opposite of positive thinking. However sometimes I do it.
        </p>

        <p>
            On the first day of the conference John and I walked up to the stand at 8:05am with our takeaway coffees.
            There were already people
            on the conference floor. I started to play our 20 minute looping video and then as I turned
            around, someone came straight up and engaged. John also got nabbed within seconds.
            Between the first person talking to me and the next I had literally 10 seconds of a breather
            and looked around and saw that Sean had arrived and both Sean and John were busy talking
            to more interested delegates. Then I was engaged again. We were all full time busy right from the start
            up until the main conference track started at 9:30am. My coffee was cold. Wow. That
            90 minutes ripped the fear of looking silly right out of me. In the quiet few moments that followed,
            I looked at John and Sean and said <i>"We're gonna need a bigger boat"</i>.
            It felt like I was taken out of normal life and placed on a big stand of a big company and told to act like
            I belonged there. It defiantly felt that strange, but there were no smoke and mirrors here.
        </p>

        <p>
            The term 'smoke and mirrors' is a term used in start-ups where you pretend you are bigger
            than you actually are in order to get business. ag-Grid needed none of this, the story spoke
            for itself. The company was completely self funded from sales with no investment
            capital, including no capital from me apart from sweat equity. Typically a tech
            start-up raises funds via investment, creates a product, and then has a target of becoming profitable before
            the funds run out. ag-Grid has not raised capital and was creating profit.
            The product offering is so successful that the company skipped the start-up stage with regards
            financial bootstrapping. So the risk associated with dealing with a young startup doesn't
            exist for us because of the zero leverage existing within the company.
            All of the people working in ag-Grid are on full salaries.
            The people at the stand were not my friends and family - another trick used by some start-ups!
            With regards affordability of the conference for us, the cost of the conference was easily
            covered by the monthly ag-Grid sales. That month we still turned profit similar to the months
            before. So there was never any doubt in my mind that we belonged sponsoring Angular Connect
            at that level, the only discomfort was due to fear of the unknown and us as a team not keeping
            up emotionally with how successful ag-Grid was becoming.

        <p>
            When I spoke at Angular Connect in 2015 ag-Grid had 2,000 downloads per month with no backing
            company (just me in my spare time). For Angular Connect 2016 ag-Grid had 32,000 downloads per month
            with offices, employees, an enterprise offering and hundreds of customers. That story
            speaks for itself.
        </p>

        <p>
            The rest of the conference continued with the same energy as the first 90 minutes. During the
            talking tracks the stand was quiet as delegates attended the talks. We used this quiet time
            for more involved one-on-one sessions with people who wanted to get a deeper knowledge of ag-Grid
            and for them to show us how they wanted to use ag-Grid.
            As for the time between tracks, our stand was very busy. It was constant talking to interested
            parties, showing demo's on our laptops, answering questions, getting feedback.
        </p>

        <p>
            At one point between tracks, one individual came up and said <i>"I wanted to say thank you for
            making my life so much easier".</i> We had a conversation for a few minutes and he asked if he could
            take a selfie with me! Now I know fully well that ag-Grid
            is used by companies, a lot of which are banks and private equity funds, and solving the worlds
            humanitarian problems is not what we do. But for this guy, his problem was displaying a large
            amount of data on a web page and ag-Grid helped him do this.
            He wanted a selfie. That was cool.

        </div>

        <p>
            Part of our sponsorship included presenting a <a hreg="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jamr2jmEzh8">
            five minute lightening talk</a> on the main track on the second day.
            It was between two popular talks so we had a lot of people in the room.
            Sean and I were to deliver the talk, with me talking
            and Sean on the laptop driving the demo. We were going to show how ag-Grid can use Angular 2
            internally in the grid for customising the cells, something Sean had been working on for the previous
            weeks. Before getting on stage we stood at the back of the conference hall and I started to
            prepare mentally. Inside I kept saying <i>"this is great, look confident, deliver one message well,
            put energy on the stage, get peoples attention, tell everyone with confidence ag-Grid is
            the best data grid in the world"</i>, complete positive mental thinking and physicing myself
            up. I started bouncing up and down lightly on my heels to get the energy going.
            Our main contact with the Angular Connect organisers was June, a very professional lady
            who was now standing beside us wearing a headset and holding a clipboard looking like she was running a security detail
            for us. One minute to our stage time I couldn't resist, I got her attention and said
            <i>"June, I presume I can't say the word 'f#ck' during the talk"</i>, she released one ear from her
            headset and exclaimed <i>"WHAT?"</i> so I repeated <i>"I presume I can't say the word 'f#ck'?"</i>, <i>"Nooooooooo"</i>
            she said pretty loud with disbelief at the question <i>"what about b#llocks then?"</i>, <i>"Noooooooooooo"</i>
            she repeated as the disbelief went to confusion and possibly panic management <i>"then what about feck
            then, surly I can say the work feck?"</i>, <i>"You can't say any of those words"</i> and worry started to creep
            into her face, <i>"then what's the worst word I can say?". </i> Sean and John were keeling over in their
            failed attempts to constrain their
            laughter, oh dear, the pressure, the poor girl, June I apologise for having to put up with
            me!!! <i>"I'm only joking June, relax, I'm sorry!!!!"</i>, <i>"Please don't do that"</i> . . . . . . . looking
            back, that was a really funny moment!!!

                    3 minute lightening talk</a>.
            </div>
        </div>

        <p>
            We went on stage. They didn't have
            the strong spot lights this time pointing at the stage, so I could see the room better.
            We used less than 3 minutes, gave our one message, and then boldly told everyone
            that ag-Grid is the best JavaScript data grid in the world. No smoke and mirrors there either.
            I truly believe it is.
        </p>

        <p>
            Every couple of months something in ag-Grid happens that forces me to step back and say "wow".
            Things keep happening above and beyond my expectations for the company. This month, it was
            really a time to realise how far we have come. Had you of told me six months ago we would be
            coming back to Angular Connect as major sponsors, I would not have believed you. It is
            incredible how things have progressed in the space of one year.
            Then in addition to actually sponsoring Angular Connect, to do it so comfortably within the company, both
            financially and to have the support of an ag-Grid team, just enforces how strong the project
            has become and makes me look forward with anticipation to it's future.
        </p>

        <p>
            In hind sight, sponsoring Angular Connect was 100% the right thing to do. We feel it helps
            build our brand as an enterprise company. We spoke to hundreds of delegates,
            a lot of who will end up either becoming customers or helping spread the word about ag-Grid.
            We were also a bit wet behind the ears when it comes to sponsoring conferences, so the best
            way to learn was to just do it. So basically the ag-Grid conference task force got a crash
            course in how it's all done.
        </p>

        <p>
            If you have heard of ag-Grid before, then we hope you are happy with our progress. If you have
            not, then please check us out. I have this feeling we are going to be around for a while.

                    Attending a conference as a speaker and attending as a sponsor are different experiences. The biggest
                    difference for me is as a speaker, it felt like I was treated like a prize winner. As a speaker the
                    previous year
                    the organisers would of paid for my flights (which I didn't need as I live in London) and hotel
                    (I took the hotel, why not, save me the tube
                    ride to the conference arena), they took me out for dinner as part of the 'speakers dinner' the night before
                    the conference, you get special use of a green room with healthy food and drinks and I got to speak about
                    ag-Grid for 25 minutes on the main stage (good free online exposure for ag-Grid). As a sponsor you
                    get none of the speaker perks, have to pay a wad of cash, and only get 5 minutes on the stage!!
