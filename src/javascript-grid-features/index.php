    <p>
        The features part of the documentation goes through all the features in detail
        along with examples.
    </p>

    <h2 id="examples">Examples</h2>

    <p>
        Most of the examples are provided in plain JavaScript. Where examples are available
        in your framework of choice, these will also be linked to.
    </p>

    <h2 id="examples">Free vs Enterprise Features</h2>

    <p>
        All enterprise features are marked with the following symbol in the menu:
    </p>
    <div style="margin-top: 10px; margin-bottom: 20px; display: inline-block; padding: 20px; border: 1px solid lightgrey;">
        <img   src="../images/enterprise_50.png"/>
    </div>

    <p>
        When you see this symbol, the feature is only available in ag-Grid Enterprise.
