    <p>
        ag-Grid is designed to work on touch devices. By default, browsers convert tap events to mouse
        click events. This means, for example, if you tap on a cell in ag-Grid, the cell will get selected
        just like you clicked on the cell with a mouse. The remainder of this page explains touch gestured
        understood by the grid which are NOT simply the grid reacting to taps as mouse clicks. They are touch
        gestures coded into the grid.
