        <h3>Living The Coders Dream</h3>

        <p>
            ag-Grid has two versions, one free and one paid. It's the paid version of ag-Grid that
            allows ag-Grid to thrive as a company and continue it's work creating the best JavaScript
            datagrid in the world. Since launching less than one year ago, we have over
            500 paying customers including 10% of the Fortune 500.
        </p>

        <p>
            So we have managed to live the coder's dream - moving an open-source project
            into a successful commercial offering. So what do you do when you have a revenue
            stream and want to give back? For us, it was clear, continue to do what
            people paid us to do, supporting and improving the project! But the idea of giving back was always in my mind.
        </p>

        <h3>Donations vs Company Expense</h3>

        <p>
            I met <a href="https://github.com/TheLarkInn">Sean Larkin</a>, one of the Webpack founders,
            at ng-Vikings in Copenhagen
            earlier this year. I have been impressed by Webpack since coming across it a few years
            ago. It was a pleasure to meet Sean and great to realise he was an absolute gentleman.
            We had a good conversation about our respective projects and comparing how we funded them.
        </p>

        <p>
            One thing that stood out was the privileged position ag-Grid is in. Because ag-Grid
            is a datagrid, it is a component that companies can justify spending money on.
            I think this is because you can show a datagrid to your users and get justification for spending
            money, however it's difficult to justify a spend on tooling as your users don't care if something
            makes developers lives easier.
        </p>

        <p>
            When ag-Grid started off there was a donation button on the website. In the first year
            it raised approx £800. It was great to get those donations and motivated me to continue
            working on the project, however it was small money in comparison to a salary to allow me to
            continue living in London. With ag-Grid Enterprise, one
            or two licenses quickly paid more than the whole previous year's donations. It was as if
            there were people waiting in the background for the possibility to expense something
            against their company. I presume this is
            because it is far more likely for an ag-Grid user to convince their employers
            to purchase ag-Grid than it is for them to donate.
        </p>

        <h3>ag-Grid Giving Back</h3>

        <p>
            Finding ourselves in this position, we wondered what could we do for our unrelated cousin
            Webpack? Apart from giving them generous amounts of money every month?
            Well not much, so we have decided to give them generous amounts of money every
            month. One open-source project with revenue helping out another open-source project that
            we believe is very deserving.
        </p>

        <p>
            So I got back in touch with Sean and said <i>"Hey can our projects be partners and for us to be
            a major source of funding for you"</i> and Sean was like <i>"Well, yeah!"</i>.
            So we have decided to start sending funds to
            Webpack, starting at $2,500 per month and see where it takes us. All funds in and out
            of Webpack can be found on the excellently managed
            <a href="https://opencollective.com/webpack#sponsor">Open Collaborative</a>.
            So if you are a user of ag-Grid or Webpack, you can be happy that some of our revenue
            is making it's way to Webpack and you can track exactly how it is spent.
        </p>

        <h3>Corporate 'Open-Source' Social Responsibility</h3>
        <p>
            So that's it - it's simple. ag-Grid is not a big corporation (6 employees and counting) but
            we fully appreciate our place in the JavaScript world and want to spread the ethos of what
            we believe is our CSR (<a href="http://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/corp-social-responsibility.asp">
            Corporate Social Responsibility</a>), but instead of contributing towards our
            local communities, we want to contribute to our friends in the open-source community.
            We have chosen Webpack as our first as it's a deserving project. In the
            future, who knows where this is going, baby steps for now, but wouldn't it be great if we
            had an ag-Grid Open Source collaborative??!!
        </p>

        <p>
            If you are a profitable company, then I urge you to do the same. Great projects like Webpack
            do need help and companies like us can do our bit. It is just not possible for these projects
            to continue to survive on donations alone. If the ag-Grid company had a conscience, I'm pretty
            sure it would be feeling pretty happy about itself right now.
        </p>
