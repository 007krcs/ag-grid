<h2 id="overview">Text Filter</h2>
<p>
    Text filters allow users to filter data based on the text contained in the column where this filter is defined. To
    create a new text filter in a column, all you need to do is:
</p>
<ol>
    <li><a href="../javascript-grid-filtering/#enable-filtering"> Enable filtering on that column</a></li>
    <li>Set the filter type to text</li>
</ol>

<p>In order to set the filter type to text you need to add the following to your column definition</p>


<p><pre>colDef:{
    filter:'text'
}</pre></p>

<note>
    <p>Enterprise users have <a href="../javascript-grid-set-filtering/">Set Filter</a> as the default type</p>

    <p>Non enterprise users have text filter as the default filter type. If you are not enterprise user,
        you don't need to specify filter:'text' since it is your default filter type</p>
</note>


<h2 id="params">Text Filter Parameters</h2>
<p>
    A text filter can take the following parameters:
    <ul>
    <li><b>newRowsAction:</b> What to do when new rows are loaded. The default is to reset the filter.
        If you want to keep the filter status between row loads, then set this value to 'keep'.</li>
    <li><b>applyButton:</b> Set to true to include an 'Apply' button with the filter and not filter
        automatically as the selection changes.</li>
    <li><b>clearButton:</b> Set to true to include a 'Clear' button with the filter which when cliked
        will remove the filter conditions to this filter.</li>
    </ul>

The parameters for the filter must be specified in the property filterParams inside the column definition
object
<p><pre>colDef:{
    filter:'text',
    filterParams:{
        ...
    }
}</pre></p>
</p>

<h2 id="model">Text Filter Model</h2>

<p>
    Get and set the state of the text filter by getting and setting the model on the filter instance.
</p>

    <p><pre><span class="codeComment">// get filter instance</span>
var athleteFilterComponent = gridOptions.api.getFilterInstance('athlete');

<span class="codeComment">// get filter model</span>
var model = athleteFilterComponent.getModel();

<span class="codeComment">// OR set filter model and update</span>
athleteFilterComponent.setModel({
    type:'endsWith',
    filter:'thing'
});
athleteFilterComponent.onFilterChanged()
</pre></p>

<p>
    The text filter model has the following attributes:
</p>
<ul>
    <li><b>type:</b> The type of text filter to apply. One of: {equals, notEquals, contains, notContains,
        startsWith, endsWith}</li>
    <li><b>filter:</b> The actual filter text to apply.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="floating">Floating Text Filter</h2>
<p>
    If your grid has floatingFilter enabled, your columns with text filter will automatically show below the header a new
    column that will show two elements:

<ul>
    <li>Filter input box: This input box serves two purposes:
        <ol>
            <li>
                Lets the user change directly the filtering text that will be used for filtering.
            </li>
            <li>It reflects any change made to the filtering text from anywhere within the application. This includes
            changes on the rich filter for this column made by the user directly or changes made to the filter through
            a call to setModel to this filter component</li>
        </ol>
        </li>
    <li>Filter button: This button is a shortcut to show the rich filter editor</li>
</ul>
</p>
