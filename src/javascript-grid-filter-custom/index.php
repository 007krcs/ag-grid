    <p>
        There are several ways to refine the way your column filters look & feel in ag-grid.
        They all based around components which mean that you can use your favourite framework too:
        <ol>
            <li>Create <a href="../javascript-grid-filter-component/">your own custom rich filter</a></li>
            <li>Create your own custom floating filter</li>
            <li>Create <a href="../javascript-grid-date-component/">your own custom date component</a> and customise your own date picker. (Applies to the default date filter
                and the date floating filter)
            </li>

        </ol>
    </p>
