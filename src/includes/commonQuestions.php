<dl id="faq">
<dt>What is the difference between Single Application Developer License and Multiple Application Developer License?</dt>
<dd>
    <p>
        Single Application developer license ties the license to <strong>one particular application</strong> within your organisation.
        A typical example is <strong>5 licenses</strong> to cover an application with <strong>5 developers</strong> working concurrently on it.
        This is best if you a) have only one (or a fixed number) of applications you need to license or b) you
        want to <strong>charge the license</strong> to a particular project(s).
    </p>

    <p>
        Multiple Application developer license allows unlimited applications to be developed by a fixed number of developers.
        A typical example is 5 license to cover an <strong>unlimited number of applications</strong> with 5 developers working
        across all applications concurrently. Use site license if you want to cover a group
        of developers developing any number of applications.

<dt>What are OEM and SaaS Licenses?</dt>
<dd>
    <p>
        SaaS is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_as_a_service">Software as a Service</a>.
        If you will be <strong>selling
        ag-Grid</strong> as part of a SaaS then you require an additional SaaS license.
    </p>

    <p>
        OEM is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Original_equipment_manufacturer">Original Equipment
            Manufacturer</a>. If you will be <strong>selling
        ag-Grid</strong> as part of your product then you require additional OEM license.
    </p>
</dd>

<dt>Do developers have to be named?</dt>
<dd>
    <p>
        No. If you license an application you provide the number of developers working on that application.
        We trust that you do not go over the number of concurrent developers on that application at any
        given time. Developers moving on and off projects is expected to be normal.
    </p>
</dd>

<dt>What does perpetual mean?</dt>
<dd>
    <p>
        The perpetual nature of the Enterprise license means you can continue to use the version of
        <strong>ag-Grid Enterprise</strong>, plus any release for one year, indefinitely. There is no requirement to
        pay again to continue using the software. However if you wish to keep up to date with the
        latest versions of <strong>ag-Grid</strong> after one year and continue with support, you must extend the
        license.
